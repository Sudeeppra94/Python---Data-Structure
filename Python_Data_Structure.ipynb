        "   - Importance of Data Structures:\n",
        "       ->Efficiency: The right data structure can significantly reduce the time complexity of operations like searching, inserting, deleting, or updating data. For example, using a hash table instead of a list can make lookups faster.\n",

        "       ->Memory Management: Different data structures offer different ways of storing data. For instance, a linked list may be more memory-efficient when the number of elements is unknown or varies dynamically, compared to a fixed-size array.\n",

        "Q4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "   - In Python, dictionaries are data structures that store data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a specific value. Dictionaries are highly efficient for lookups, insertions, and deletions because of their underlying implementation. Here’s a detailed explanation of how dictionaries store data:\n",
        "   1. Key-Value Pairs\n",
        "   - A dictionary is composed of keys and values. Each key maps to a value, where the key acts as a unique identifier for the associated value.\n",
        "   2. Hashing Mechanism (How Keys are Stored)\n",
        "   - Internally, dictionaries use a technique called hashing to efficiently store and retrieve data. When a key is added to the dictionary, Python computes a hash value for the key using a built-in hash function.\n",
        "   - A hash function takes the key and returns a unique hash code (integer). This hash code determines where the key-value pair will be stored in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For example, if the key is \"name\", Python will hash this string and use the hash code to place the key-value pair at a specific location in an internal array (or table).\n",
        "   3. Handling Collisions\n",
        "   - Since a hash function maps keys to integer values (hash codes), it is possible for two different keys to produce the same hash code. This is known as a collision."

        "   - In Python, sets and lists are both collections used to store data, but they have different characteristics that make them suited to different use cases. Here are several reasons why you might use a set instead of a list:\n",
        "   1. Uniqueness of Elements\n",
        "   - Sets automatically enforce uniqueness—they do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored. This is useful when you need to ensure that no repeated items are present in the collection.\n",
        "   - Lists, on the other hand, allow duplicate elements, which can be a problem if you want to avoid storing repeated values.\n",
        "   2. Faster Membership Testing\n",
        "   - Sets provide O(1) average-time complexity for membership testing (i.e., checking if an element is in the set), which is significantly faster than - - lists, which have an average-time complexity of O(n) for membership tests.\n",
        "This makes sets ideal when you need to check whether an item is present in a collection frequently, as lookups are much faster in sets.\n",
        "   3. Set Operations\n",
        "   - Sets support efficient set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations are not natively supported by lists in Python.\n",
        "   - If you need to perform mathematical set operations (e.g., finding common elements, removing duplicates, or combining sets), a set is the more appropriate data structure."
